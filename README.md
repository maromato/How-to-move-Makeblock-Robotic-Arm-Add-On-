Demo.ino is the revised code for the mBlock Robotic-Arm-Add-On-Pack-For-Starter-Robot-Kit.
Some Important tips as follws.
1. we need to download several libraries for this code: MeOrion.h, SoftwareSerial.h
2. MeOrion.h is included mBlock libraries deposited in the official Github (https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries)
3. SoftwareSerial.h can be downloaded by elsewhere(https://www.robot-r-us.com/e/995-softwareserial.html)
4. There libraries can be installed by Ardiuno software.(Scatch/Inclued libraries/)
5. The board "Ardiuno/Genuino Uno"should be selected, otherwise the compile will not be finished sucessfully.
6. The IR receiver module connect on port 3! Port 5 is not working by some reason.
